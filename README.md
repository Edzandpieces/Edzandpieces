##My name is Ed and I'm a Product Manager living in Tokyo, Japan. 
</h2>

During my time attending Le Wagon's 9 week bootcamp, I was a Project Manager and worked with a magnificient team of 3 other developers to create an app called <a href="https://nurture-lw.herokuapp.com/">Nurture</a>, which helps tutors maintain feedback and monitor their student's progress.

People say I have a good voice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and as I have a passion for both digital technology and promotion, I've have spoken to large audiences before on all <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmund-0h/overlay/1635493073057/single-media-viewer?type=DOCUMENT&profileId=ACoAADv9-wUBAzGcXLjmguOQxFCYwTPRi9Ha7Y0&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BhaCrLlllSyq7H%2F%2BPqIAk6w%3D%3D">sorts of tech related subjects</a>.

I'm currently working on a few projects related to front-end development, as I love finding new ways to use JS / CSS for my websties and making my clients show the üò≤ face, when they see my designs. If you're interested on collaborating or have a product management position that needs some support, don't be shy, <a href="https://github.com/Edzandpieces">come say hi!</a>
